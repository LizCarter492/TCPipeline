### Smith & Carter, **Increasing hazardous material pipeline failures during tropical cyclones: trends and future implications**
Tropical cyclones (TCs, including hurricanes) have caused nearly $1.5 trillion in damages in the US since 1980—more than all other kinds of natural disasters combined. TCs frequently intersect with America’s hazardous materials pipeline network: a vast network of pipes that transport the majority of crude oil and natural gas to the public. Since 1970, over 30,000 pipeline failures have been reported, causing hundreds of deaths and billions in damages. TCs are under-recognized as causes of pipeline failures, mainly because of how failures are reported. In this study, we make a conservative inventory of pipeline failures that are associated with TCs. TCs impacting pipeline infrastructure have intensified since 1970 due to climate change. Because of this, the frequency of storm-associated pipeline failures has doubled since 1975. If current trends continue, the number of pipeline failures per TC could increase by 50-600%, putting more pressure on the already vulnerable pipeline infrastructure. Spatial variability in the frequency of pipeline failures after TCs gives some clues as to causes, including coastal storm surges, tornados, and mechanical forcing from shrink swell clays. These findings highlight the urgent need for TC-specific regulatory measures to protect hazardous material pipelines from intensifying TCs.
