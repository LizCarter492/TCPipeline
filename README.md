# This repository contains data and code presented in Smith & Carter, **Increasing hazardous material pipeline failures during tropical cyclones: trends and future implications**, ERL, *in submission*
Tropical cyclones impact nineteen US States, and have caused nearly $1.5 trillion in damages since 1980, more than all other kinds of natural disasters combined. Hazardous material pipelines in the U.S. are at increasing risk of failure due to tropical cyclones (TCs), and this risk is growing with climate change. Since 1970, over 30,000 pipeline failures have been reported, causing hundreds of deaths and billions in damages. Yet, TCs are not always recognized as a direct cause of these failures. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between TCs and pipeline failures, finding that over 70% of failures in cyclone-prone regions happen within a year of a storm. As TCs have become stronger, the frequency of pipeline failures has doubled since 1975. Spatial variability in the frequency of pipeline failures after TCs gives some clues to causes, including coastal storm surges, tornados, and mechanical forcing from shrink swell clays. TC storm tracks impacting pipeline infrastructure have intensified significantly since 1970, and if current trends continue, the number of pipeline failures per TC could increase by 50-600%, putting more pressure on the already vulnerable pipeline infrastructure. These findings highlight the urgent need for TC-specific regulatory measures and better preparedness to deal with the increasing threats posed by tropical cyclones.
